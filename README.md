# Task-10-Firewall-Configuration-Testing
1. Firewall Setup and Rule Configuration
Configured firewall using UFW / Windows Firewall to control incoming and outgoing network traffic. Created rules to allow required ports and deny unnecessary ports for system security.

2. Allow and Deny Port Testing
Allowed specific ports (example: 22 for SSH) and denied unused ports. Tested connectivity using tools like ping and telnet to confirm that firewall rules are working correctly.

3. Malicious IP Blocking and Log Monitoring
Blocked a suspicious IP address to prevent unauthorized access. Monitored firewall logs to observe blocked and allowed traffic activities.

4. Documentation and Security Impact
Documented all firewall rules and analyzed their impact. Firewall helps protect the system from unauthorized access, reduces attack surface, and improves overall network security.
